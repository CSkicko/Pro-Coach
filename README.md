## Description
This application is aimed at providing a platform for early career professionals to access industry experts for advice and guidance.
The application allows users to register with either a learner or coach profile and add their skills. Skills are either desired (for learners) or acquired (for coaches).

Once learners have added their skills, they have the ability to search for coaches based on a specific skill, and request a session with their selected coach on a specific date.
Session requests include custom messages provided by the user.

Coaches have the ability to accept or reject session requests at their discretion.

All scheduled sessions can be viewed through the user's profile.
